**Open-source contributor | Systems & Developer Tools**

I'm an open-source contributor focused on building practical, well-documented tools that make developers' lives easier. I care deeply about clean architecture, reproducibility, and long-term maintainability.

I enjoy working at the intersection of developer experience, infrastructure, and automation, and I'm especially drawn to projects that value clarity over complexity.
